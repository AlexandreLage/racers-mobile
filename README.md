Hey, I'm glad you are here.

First you need to clone this repository
Then you need to install the project's dependencies

`npm install && npx pod-install`

Then you can either open it on XCode (for iOS), Android Studio (for Android) or run one of the command lines defined in the package.json

`npm run android`

`npm run ios`
